- Implemented namespaced message pattern support in #[msg_flow], ensuring explicit subject subscriptions instead of wildcard reliance. (done)

- Make event attribute (done)

- Make Error Handling Recoverable in Message Listener: Ensure that message listener threads do not panic when encountering errors.
    Instead, errors must be handled gracefully and the thread should continue listening on subscribed patterns.
    This improves system resilience and prevents disruption of active message flows. (done)

- Support Dynamic Schemas for Structs Without Fields: Allow structs without fields to be used with non-associated methods defined in their impl block.
     For these cases, input parsing is skipped, and the struct acts as a dynamic schema. Example:

- complete error system : write rules for passing a defined Error schema to handle_error function
